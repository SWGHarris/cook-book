# Cook Book

This is an app bootstrapped according to the [init.tips](https://init.tips) stack, also known as the T3-Stack.

I used [this guide](https://www.nexxel.dev/blog/ct3a-guestbook) written by [nexxel](https://www.nexxel.dev/) to get up and running.

Cook Book is a cooking recipe web app to help me manage and share recipes with my friends.
